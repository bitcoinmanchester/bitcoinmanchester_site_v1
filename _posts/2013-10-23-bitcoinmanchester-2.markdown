Max was at [Bitcoin Conference Europe][conference] at the end of September:

He's going to give us a run down on what he saw. Among other things, he spoke to people from 3 new exchanges and a new peer-to-peer exchange, and had a look at a TREZOR hardware wallet too.

There's been lots going on in the Bitcoin world since the first meeting in June, so we can have a discussion about the news afterwards.

We're [at the MadLab][madlab-event] again.
