**VENUE CHANGE**: Our venue is organised by [MadLab][madlab-event] as usual, but due to revonation works, this month we're in **New Federation House** ([directions][nfh-directions]). It's only a few minutes round the corner - if you get lost, turn up to MadLab as normal and someone will direct you!

October's speaker will be Jason Kelly of Isle of Man based [Qwikbit Solutions Limited][qwikbit]. Qwikbit installs and operates Bitcoin AVMs ("kind of like an ATM, only for Bitcoins") in the UK and their stated mission is to ensure that Bitcoin is as widely available and easy to purchase as possible. Qwikbit owns a number of [Lamassu][lamassu] Bitcoin automated vending machines and they intend to launch a number of their AVMs in Manchester in the near future.

Jason will speak about the history of Qwikbit, the operation of their Lamassu AVMs (We are hoping that Jason will have one of his Lamassu AVM's with him in October to demonstrate to the group!) and will also bring insight into the development of the positive environment for Bitcoin businesses on the Isle of Man, recently styled in Daily Telegraph as ["Bitcoin Island"][bitcoin-island]. He's also happy to answer questions and talk about any other topics the audience would like to hear about.

As always we'll have sponsored pizza provided by one of the Bitcoin-accepting [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors. Finally we'll head to the pub.
