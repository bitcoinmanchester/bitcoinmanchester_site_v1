This month Gareth Luckett ([@garethluckett]) will be talking about Bitcoin mining. He will cover the history of mining, how to get started mining, solo mining and mining pools. If you are trying to mine Bitcoins for profit, he will talk about how to ensure that you don’t lose money in the process.

Gareth will also bring some mining hardware along such as (subject to availability), an ASIC miner and an FPGA miner.

More than likely we'll also end up in conversation about [Mt.Gox][mtgox], or what's left of it.

As always we'll have sponsored pizza provided by one of the [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors. Finally we'll head to the pub.

We're at [MadLab][madlab-event] as usual.
