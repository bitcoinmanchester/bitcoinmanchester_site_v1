## Bitcoin in South-East Asia

For the last four months, Max (group organiser) aka [@MaaxSan][@MaaxSan] has been travelling through South-East Asia, including China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. He has met a number of Bitcoiners on the way. He's going to give information and reviews regarding a number of companies he used to finance his travels through some of the countries. This will include facts and figures to see if travelling with bitcoin really does cut it or if it's only a pipedream!

## Pizza & Pub

As always we'll have sponsored pizza provided by one of the Bitcoin-accepting [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors.

Finally at around 9pm we'll head to the pub, which of course is our old friend [Common][common] over the road.
