This month Ash will be starting off with a technical talk that will explain
a bit about how Bitcoin addresses, transactions and the blockchain work. It
won't get uber-technical, and the aim is to be a good intro for beginners
but also interesting to people with an understanding of the Bitcoin protocol.

After that we'll have a round-up of the news again (bubble or no bubble?!)
and a discussion about recent developments. Finally we'll head to the pub!

BTW there will be sponsored pizza and other bites. If the exchange rate on
[PizzaForCoins][pizzaforcoins] isn't obscene they'll be paid for with bitcoins,
otherwise boring old electronic fiat it is.

We're [at the MadLab][madlab-event] again.
