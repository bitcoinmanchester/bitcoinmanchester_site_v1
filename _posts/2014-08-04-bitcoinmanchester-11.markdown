This month Jonathan "Jonny" James Harrison ([@JonnyBitcoin][jonny]) of Bitcoin ATM company [SatoshiPoint][satoshipoint] will be speaking at the group. SatoshiPoint currently manage Bitcoin ATMs in London and Bristol and are now looking for a place for their next machine. Jonny is a long-time money reformist and gold bug and believes strongly in Bitcoin.

Jonny will be talking about his interest in Bitcoin, the history of SatoshiPoint and what he thinks the future might bring. He's happy to answer questions and talk about other topics the audience would like to hear about.

As always we'll have sponsored pizza provided by one of the Bitcoin-accepting [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors. Finally we'll head to the pub.

We're at [MadLab][madlab-event] as usual.
