We don't have a speaker this month. We nearly cancelled this meetup but we've decided to run a short informal meetup at [Manchester Digital Laboratory][madlab-event] follow by a trip to the pub.

The first hour or so we'll spend in MadLab eating pizza suppled by one of the Bitcoin-accepting [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors. We'll go through the news from the last month and discuss any topics people want to raise (ranting about the election is acceptable!). New Bitcoin users are welcome to join, we can show you how to set up a wallet if you need any help.

Afterwards we'll go to [Common][common] across the road for liquid refreshment and more Bitcoin talk (ranting about the election is also acceptable here).
