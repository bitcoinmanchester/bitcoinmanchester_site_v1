This month, organisers Max and Ash (mainly Max) will will touch on a topic first presented at Bitcoin Manchester around 1 year ago: Smart Property.

Smart Property is a concept built on the ideas in Bitcoin. It uses tokens to represent contractual items, beyond being just units of currency.

The release of such software has happened and we are seeing competiting platforms which allow multiple use cases. We are going to examine one main technology and give a brief overview of its competitiors. This is the first part of series of talks examining “Bitcoin 2.0” technolology as we see new features integrated directly into and ontop of the blockchain to support our day to day lives.

As always we'll have sponsored pizza provided by one of the Bitcoin-accepting [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors. Finally we'll head to the pub.

We're at [MadLab][madlab-event] as usual.
