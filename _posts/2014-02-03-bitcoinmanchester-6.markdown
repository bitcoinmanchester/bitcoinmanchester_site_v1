We have two talks this month:

* Ash will be giving a demo of how to set up and use an offline wallet for cold storage using the [Armory] Bitcoin client. Cold storage means the Bitcoin private keys are never accessed on an internet-connected machine, which makes them harder to access, but much more secure.

* Max will be giving an overview of various alternative coin storage options. He'll look at (among other things) Brain Wallets, and give tips for using them safely.

We'll have sponsored food as usual. We'll continue rotating round the [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors and see if one of them can get us a pizza in under 9 block confirmations.

We're at [MadLab][madlab-event] as usual.
