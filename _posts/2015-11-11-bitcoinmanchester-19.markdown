As there is no talk this month, we're running a social meetup at [Common Bar][common], across the road from MadLab on Edge Street. Ilan E aka [@Hashman100][@Hashman100] is organising, and will be there to meet and greet people from 8pm.

Come along and discuss Bitcoin while enjoying the selection of fine beers, wines and ciders!
